## Motivation  
My wife is blind and suffers greatly from carpal and cubital tunnel due to using a white cane for over 40 years.  

## Primary Focus
A video capture (or similar) app that provides at least 80 percent of the information a white cane can currently provide.

## Future Focus
Functional extensions beyond the primary focus (reading street signs, for example). These are all to be tackled only AFTER the primary focus is achieved.

## Initial Impressions  
Many projects and products have come and gone... beginning long before the current AI boom. None has managed to significantly improve the capabilities of a simple white cane.

## Development Plan
1) Extensive tests to determine the base audible feedback plan.
